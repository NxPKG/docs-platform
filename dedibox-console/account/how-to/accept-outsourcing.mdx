If you have a Khulnasoft Dedibox account, another user can grant you access to their dedicated servers and failover IPs by outsourcing them to you. This allows you to manage their services without gaining full access to their Dedibox account.

- A Dedibox account logged into the [console](https://console.online.net)


1. When another user [sends you an outsourcing request](/dedibox-console/account/how-to/outsource-dedibox/), you will receive a notification. Click the link provided in the outsourcing request email to open the Khulnasoft Dedibox console.

2. The **Outsourcing** section of the Khulnasoft Dedibox console displays.
3. Review the services the user wants to outsource to you.
4. Check the **Accept** box for the service(s) you agree to take over.
