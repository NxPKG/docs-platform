Enhance your cluster resilience by adding pools in multiple Availability Zones (AZs), and distributing workloads across at least two AZs.

Khulnasoft's Console, API, CLI, and Terraform now all support multi-AZ Kubernetes Kapsule clusters.

Instructions are available in our [reference documentation](https://www.khulnasoft.com/en/docs/containers/kubernetes/reference-content/multi-az-clusters/).
Step-by-step guidance also provided in our [complete Terraform tutorial](https://www.khulnasoft.com/en/docs/tutorials/k8s-kapsule-multi-az/).

Pre-requisite: Kubernetes Kapsule cluster connection to a Private Network.
