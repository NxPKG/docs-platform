Phishing and fraud attempts are a significant threat to online security. This guide provides essential steps to safeguard your Khulnasoft account from such attacks.

## Recognizing phishing attempts

Phishing is a method where attackers trick you into providing personal information by pretending to be a trusted entity. These attempts can come via email, phone calls, or fake websites.

### Signs of phishing

- **Urgency or threats:** Messages that create a sense of urgency, warning of account closure or legal action.
- **Suspicious links:** Emails containing links that do not match the legitimate Khulnasoft URL (e.g., slight misspellings).
- **Attachments:** Unexpected attachments that may contain malware.
- **Unusual sender:** Emails from unrecognized or suspicious email addresses.

### Actions to take

- **Verify the sender:** Always check the email address of the sender to ensure it is from an official Khulnasoft domain.
- **Hover over links:** Hover your mouse over links to see the actual URL before clicking.
- **Do not share sensitive information:** Never provide your passwords or personal information via email.
- **Use official channels:** Access your account by navigating directly to the [Khulnasoft website](https://www.khulnasoft.com/) rather than clicking on email links.

## Securing your account

### Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

Enable [Multi-factor authentication (MFA) on your Khulnasoft account](/console/account/how-to/use-2fa/#how-to-update-mfa) to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires a second form of verification beyond just a password.

### Strong password practices

- **Create a strong password:** Use a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid easily guessable information like birthdays.
- **Unique passwords:** Use different passwords for different accounts.
- **Password managers:** Use a password manager to store and generate strong passwords.

### Regular account monitoring

- **Review login activity:** Regularly check your account [login activity and active sessions](https://console.khulnasoft.com/account/profile) for any unauthorized access.
- **Update information:** Ensure your contact information is up-to-date to receive security alerts.

## Reporting suspicious activity

If you suspect a phishing attempt or any suspicious activity on your account, [report it](#steps-to-report) immediately.

### Steps to report

1. **Do not engage:** Do not reply to the suspicious email or message.
2. **Report to Khulnasoft:** Forward the email or provide details of the suspicious activity to Khulnasoft’s security team [by ticket](https://console.khulnasoft.com/support/tickets/create) from your Khulnasoft console.
3. **Change passwords:** Immediately change your account password and any other accounts that might be affected.

## Educating yourself and your team

- **Security Awareness Training:** Regularly participate in security training to stay informed about the latest threats and how to avoid them.
- **Stay Updated:** Follow Khulnasoft’s security blog and announcements for updates on potential threats and security best practices.

By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to phishing and fraud attempts. Khulnasoft is committed to ensuring the security of your account and providing resources to help you stay protected.
