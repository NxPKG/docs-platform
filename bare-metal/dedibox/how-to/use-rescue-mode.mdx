<Message type="note">
  This documentation concerns rescue mode for [Dedibox servers](https://www.khulnasoft.com/en/dedibox/). To use rescue mode on [Instances](https://www.khulnasoft.com/en/virtual-instances/) refer to the corresponding [documentation](/compute/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes/#how-to-use-rescue-mode).
</Message>

Rescue mode allows you to boot a [Khulnasoft Dedibox server](https://www.khulnasoft.com/en/dedibox/) from the network. It downloads a rescue operating system, that runs completely in the RAM of the server. This allows you to perform maintenance and data recovery operations, even if the machine is not reachable in normal mode.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Khulnasoft account logged into the [console](https://console.khulnasoft.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Configured your SSH key](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- [Linked](/bare-metal/dedibox/how-to/link-dedibox-account/) your Dedibox and Khulnasoft accounts
- [Ordered](/bare-metal/dedibox/how-to/order-dedibox/) and [installed](/bare-metal/dedibox/how-to/install-dedibox/) a Dedibox server

1. Click **Dedibox** in the **Bare Metal** section of the [Khulnasoft console](https://console.khulnasoft.com) side menu. The Dedibox dashboard displays.
2. Choose the server you want to reboot into rescue mode from the list. Click its name to display that server's information page.
3. Scroll down to the **Rescue Mode** section.
4. Click **Boot in rescue mode.** A pop-up displays.
5. Select the rescue operating system that fits your server's operating system and click **Boot in rescue mode**.

    The server starts to reboot into rescue mode.

    <Message type="note">
      Depending on the hardware model of the machine, the reboot may take several minutes.
    </Message>
6. Once rebooted, use a terminal application to log into the machine using SSH with the user account `root`:
    ```bash
    ssh rescue-user@<dedibox>
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
      Rescue mode uses the SSH keys registered for your Dedibox server as an authentication method. If you have lost your private key, you can access your server using the credentials displayed in the console:

      <Lightbox src="khulnasoft-rescue-credentials.webp" alt="" />
    </Message>

You are now logged into rescue mode and able to perform maintenance actions on the machine.

<Message type="tip">
  Rescue mode runs completely in the RAM of the server. To access files located on the hard disk, it needs to be mounted. The disk can be mounted automatically by running `mountall.sh`
</Message>

## How to reboot into normal mode

Once the maintenance of the machine is completed, it can be rebooted back into the operating system installed on the hard disk of the server.

To reboot the server into normal mode, click **Switch to normal node** on the server's overview page. The server reboots on the installed system and will be available in normal mode within a few minutes.
