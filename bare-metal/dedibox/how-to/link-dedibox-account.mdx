     - Your Khulnasoft Dedibox and Khulnasoft Cloud account information will be updated with the information provided on this page.
     - You understand that linked accounts cannot be unlinked.
     - Payment information will be updated and unified based on these rules:
       - If SEPA is your preferred payment method in either account, it becomes the default choice for both Khulnasoft Cloud and Dedibox invoices.
       - If SEPA is not used, the preferred payment method of credit card remains the same for both accounts.
       - If different credit cards are used for Dedibox and Khulnasoft Cloud, the card registered with Khulnasoft Cloud becomes the default for both accounts.
            <Message type="tip">
              After linking accounts, you can modify your payment method in the [billing section](https://console.khulnasoft.com/billing/payment) of the Khulnasoft console. All default payment methods will be transferred to your linked account.
