This page shows you how to create a secret (`ultra-confidential`) and to migrate it into a path (`/confidential-path`) using the [Khulnasoft CLI](https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft-cli#installation) and the Go programming language.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Khulnasoft account logged into the [console](https://console.khulnasoft.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- Configured the [Khulnasoft CLI](https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft-cli#installation)
- [Created at least one Khulnasoft API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
- [Downloaded Go](https://go.dev/)

1. Open a terminal and run the following command to clone the repository containing the code you need to complete the procedure:

        ```
        git clone git@github.com:khulnasoft/tutorial-sem-folder-migrate.git
        ```

2. In the same terminal, paste the following commands to export your environment variables. Make sure you add your **own variables**.

    ```
    export SCW_ACCESS_KEY=<Khulnasoft-API-access-key>
    export SCW_SECRET_KEY=<Khulnasoft-API-secret-key>
    export SCW_DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_ID=<Khulnasoft default Organization>
    export SCW_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID=<Khulnasoft default Project>
    export SCW_DEFAULT_REGION="fr-par"
    export SCW_API_URL="https://api.khulnasoft.com"
    ```
3. Use the following command to access the `tutorial-sem-folder-migrate` directory:
    ```
    cd tutorial-sem-folder-migrate
    ```
4. Run `go run ./main.go` to launch the creation of your secret and the migration process.
5. Access your [Khulnasoft account](https://console.khulnasoft.com) and verify that the secret and path display in the intended Project.
