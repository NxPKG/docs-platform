Serverless Containers can be deployed and managed using various tools. This page aims to help you find the right tool for your use case.

<Message type="tip">
  You can find examples using all the deployment methods shown here in our [Serverless Examples repository](https://github.com/khulnasoft/serverless-examples).

## Khulnasoft console

The [Khulnasoft console](https://console.khulnasoft.com/) is the easiest way to get started deploying Containers.

The console lets you deploy containers from the Khulnasoft Container Registry or public repositories.

Refer to the [dedicated documentation](/serverless/containers/how-to/deploy-container/) for more information.

## Serverless framework

[Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/) is a tool dedicated to easing the deployment of serverless applications, including Khulnasoft Serverless Functions and Containers.

With Serverless Framework, you can deploy your Dockerfile as a Serverless Container via a single command: `serverless deploy`.

Your Container configuration is done via a single YAML file, which can be checked into your version control system.

Installation guides, examples, use cases, and advanced documentation are available in the [Serverless Khulnasoft Plugin repository](https://github.com/khulnasoft/serverless-khulnasoft-functions).

Serverless Framework can be used in many use cases such as CI/CD, production deployments, and multi-project deployments with [serverless-compose](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/compose).

Many of the examples found in our [Serverless Examples repository](https://github.com/khulnasoft/serverless-examples) make use of Serverless Framework, and may help you get started.

## Terraform

Serverless Containers integrate easily with your infrastructure as code, via our [Terraform provider and resources](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/khulnasoft/khulnasoft/latest/docs/resources/container).

You can find examples using Terraform in our [Serverless Examples repository](https://github.com/khulnasoft/serverless-examples), such as our [example using Terraform to deploy an NGINX container](https://github.com/khulnasoft/serverless-examples/tree/main/containers/nginx-cors-private-python).

## API

The [Khulnasoft HTTP API](https://www.khulnasoft.com/en/developers/api/) lets you manage your Serverless Containers via HTTP calls.

The HTTP API can be useful when integrating Container management into your automated tasks, continuous integration, and more custom use cases.

## CLI

The [Khulnasoft CLI](https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft-cli) is a simple command line interface that allows you to create, update, delete and list your Serverless Containers.

Installation instructions and documentation are available in the [Khulnasoft CLI repository](https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft-cli).

## Khulnasoft SDKs

The Khulnasoft Software Development Kits (SDK) allow you to manage your resources directly from your favorite languages.

The available SDKs are:

- [Go SDK](https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft-sdk-go)
- [JS SDK](https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft-sdk-js)
- [Python SDK](https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft-sdk-python)

The documentation for each SDK is held in its respective repository.
