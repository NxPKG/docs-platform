You can monitor the activity of your Serverless Jobs using the [Khulnasoft console](https://console.khulnasoft.com) to check the current status, RAM, and CPU consumption of your runs. Also, Serverless Jobs is fully integrated into Khulnasoftâ€™s Observability [Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/quickstart/) and allows you to quickly access your logs.

## How to monitor your Serverless Jobs from the Khulnasoft console

Khulnasoft Cockpit allows you to monitor your applications and their infrastructure by giving you access to metrics, logs, and traces in Grafana dashboards. 

Make sure that you have created a Grafana user and [retrieved their username and password](/observability/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/).
